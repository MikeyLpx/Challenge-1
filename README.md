# challenge 1

## Description


The motivation for this project was to improve my html skills by cleaning up the already established code by using semantic elements.
The reason for this project was to make the code more accessable and readable for anyone trying to navigate the website.
One problem that I solved while changing the code to semantic code is that the website is that the website is more accessable to people with disabilities. The code is also a lot cleaner and easier to read after revising it. I also fixed the broken search engine optimization link so it now takes you to that part of the article.
One thing I learned that writing in semantic code makes debugging a lot simpler since it makes it easier to read the code.
